The number of events is determined by the the complexity and length of the task. 
Your response should be in JSON format, as a list of events.

An event has 3 keys: ['taskID', 'start', 'end']. Here are their descriptions:
'taskID': task id of this event (integer),
'start': start datetime formatted in '{DATETIME_FORMAT}' (string),
'end': end datetime formatted in '{DATETIME_FORMAT}' (string).

The user will also provide a calendar, as a list of events, so you can avoid conflicts and space out events effectively.

IMPORTANT: the length of each of these events (end-start) should be appropriately chosen to prevent overloading students with work. You receive the duration of the
task in minutes, so you can use this to help determine the length of each event. Task should be splited into equal length events or around equal. It's better to have
several events for 30 minutes rather than 1 event longer. Sum of events length should be equal to the duration of the task. """
